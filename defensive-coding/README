Building HTML documentation
---------------------------

Just type "make".

When you type "make", the code examples in src/ are compiled (mainly
to check for obvious syntax errors, but also for manual testing).  If
you lack the necessary libraries, you can type "make build-manual"
instead, which will skip this step.  The code examples are still
included in the manual.

Dependencies
------------

Building the manual needs the "publican" package and the
"publican-redhat-engservices" package available here:

http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/publican-redhat-engservices/

Version 0.4 of the publican-redhat-engservices package needs publican
3.0.  This version of the package:

http://download.lab.bos.redhat.com/brewroot/packages/publican-redhat-engservices/0.3/2.el6eng/noarch/publican-redhat-engservices-0.3-2.el6eng.noarch.rpm

is known to work with publican 2.8 available in Fedora 17.
