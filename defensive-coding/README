TODO and bug tracking
---------------------

The secure-coding guide has its own component in Bugzilla:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora%20Documentation&component=defensive-coding-guide

Please file bugs and suggestions there.

Building HTML documentation
---------------------------

Just type "make".  If you do not want to build the example code, run
"make build-manual".

When you type "make", the code examples in src/ are compiled (mainly
to check for obvious syntax errors, but also for manual testing).  If
you lack the necessary libraries, you can type "make build-manual"
instead, which will skip this step.  The code examples are still
included in the manual.

Dependencies
------------

Building the manual needs the "publican" and the "publican-fedora"
packages.
