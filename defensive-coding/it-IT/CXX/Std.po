"Many containers similar to <literal>std::vector</literal> provide both "
"<literal>operator[](size_type)</literal> and a member function "
"<literal>at(size_type)</literal>. This applies to "
"<literal>std::vector</literal> itself, <literal>std::array</literal>, "
"<literal>std::string</literal> and other instances of "
"<literal>std::basic_string</literal>."

"<literal>operator[](size_type)</literal> is not required by the standard to "
"perform bounds checking (and the implementation in GCC does not). In "
"contrast, <literal>at(size_type)</literal> must perform such a check. "
"Therefore, in code which is not performance-critical, you should prefer "
"<literal>at(size_type)</literal> over "
"<literal>operator[](size_type)</literal>, even though it is slightly more "
"verbose."
